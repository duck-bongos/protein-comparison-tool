# Protein Comparison Tool
I've recently started to take my nutrition a lot more seriously, which includes protein intake. I get overwhelmed looking at the protein bar aisle in my grocery store, comparing each one based on leanness and price, then comparing those to non-protein bar options like vegan or animal sources of protein. It's a lot of math and numbers to remember - so I stopped and I outsourced it to an online version of myself.
